   * primary Action to attack, which requires rolling a d20 to hit the
   * target's Armor Class (AC); if that roll is successful, they then
   * roll the specified dice for damage. Finally, if an ability or spell
   * allows for a Bonus Action, the character rolls the die (or dice)
   * associated with that Bonus Action effect.
